###Kaggle.com "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" Competition Submissions###

This is where the Global Data Jammers team will put submissions and project artifacts for the Kaggle learning competition entitled "*Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster*"

Note that this is a **PRIVATE** repository primarily because this will contain our submissions to the contest and we want every enterant to do their own work. Once the competition is complete, we might release the source code and documentation if the team decides to do that.
